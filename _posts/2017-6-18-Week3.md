 **What did you do this past week?** This past week my team and I worked on our project which is to create a static website of our choosing. We chose to do a Marvel themed website named marveldb.net, which provides information about the Marvel comics, series, characters, and events that occur in the Marvel universe. I helped setup the backend of the website, which included Flask, AWS, and Apache. I worked with my teammate, Paul, in routing the correct HTML files that he created through the appropriate Flask functions, and created templates which serve to provide an inheritance hierarchy of HTML files to prevent repeating yourself in your code.
 
 **What's in your way?** AWS and Apache are very complicated technologies that served their fair share of headaches over this past week. I hope to be much more comfortable with these new technologies.

**What will you do next week?** We've just about completed phase 1 of the project, but this next phase will be much harder. We now have to create a dynamic website which serves many more instances of our Marvel models. I will have to learn how to parse JSON dynamically using Python, and then serving the correct information to my teammates making the database. It will be a much bigger step up for these next couple of weeks.

**What's my experience of the class?** One notably tough thing about this class is the requirement for us to learn all of the technologies that are required for this website outside of class. This includes React, Bootstrap, HTML/CSS/Javascript, Flask, AWS, Apache, Apiary, Slack, Trello, Git, and many more we pick up along the way. There is absolutely no hand-holding in this class.

**What is your pick-of-the-week?** Take advantage of Flask's template library, <a href="http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/2.9/templates/">Jinga2</a>, when creating your website. This drastically reduces the amount of boilerplate code in your HTML files, and avoids repeating yourself all over the place.
