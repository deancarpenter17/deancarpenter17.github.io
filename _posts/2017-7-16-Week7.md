**What did you do this past week?** This past week our group worked on phase 4 of our website that included implementing a feature that allows people to edit our website. Users can add, edit, and delete model instances from our website by clicking on a contribute link on our website. We have implemented a captcha to prevent bots from trashing our website. We talked about doing a login, but we thought a captcha would actually be the best way to prevent trashing the website.
 
 **What's in your way?** This phase of our website was actually very hard for us to do correctly. There were some database issues that stood in our way, but we have mostly removed those bugs, and are working on finishing up this phase.

**What will you do next week?** This next week we'll be preparing presentations for the Friday class. We will have 15 minutes to give a presentation over our website. It doesn't seem like enough time to cover everything that we had to do to make this website, but hopefully we can generalize enough so we cover each major point.

**What's my experience of the class?** As I've said in previous blog posts, this class has absolutely made me a better developer. The class forces you to become familiar with each part of the development lifecycle of a website. Because of all the bugs that naturally pop up in a project of this size, I had to become familiar with the backend as well as my pre-defined position of front end. This class also requires that you become very familiar with Git, which is incredibly useful as a developer.

**What is your pick-of-the-week?** React Developer Tools is a chrome extension that allows you to view the component hierarchy of a website that uses React. Since we're only using 1 HTML file in our entire app, it's not useful to look at the traditional console in the browser. Since our site is made using 95% React/JSX/Javascript, seeing a component hierarchy is much more intuitive and easy to follow.
