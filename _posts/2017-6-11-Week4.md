**What did you do this past week?** This past week our group fleshed out the details of the project and how we are going to approach each major step for phase two of building our website. This next phase requires our team to change our previous static website to a dynamic one that has many more instances of each of our models. I wrote a Marvel API scraper in Python for the backend guys to use in populating the database, and I worked with Paul in trying to learn Javascript, React, Babel, and Webpack, and how exactly React is suppose to communicate with Flask and the database. 
 
 **What's in your way?** Because none of our team has ever worked with Javascript, React, or any of the other front end technologies, this week is going to be extremely difficult. Last week we did quite a bit of research over these technologies, but these are complicated technologies that I wish we had much more time to pick up. Regardless, learning to pick up new technologies incredibly quickly is a skill that any software developer must have.

**What will you do next week?** This next week our team will be living in the computer lab. In addition to what I've described above, we have to write unit tests, implement a working API, create/populate the database, create all of the React components on the front end, pull data from our database through our API on the frontend, and set up a lot of other required technologies that our website requires.

**What's my experience of the class?** This class moves at an incredibly brisk pace, and keeping up with our project, readings, and studying for the test is proving itself to be quite difficult. The upside is that these past few weeks Professor Downing has shoved so much information in my brain that will help me for the rest of my career!

**What is your pick-of-the-week?** Our group will be experimenting this week with a library called Axios, which is available to download through npm. Axios allows you to make HTTP requests on the browser side within your Javascript/React code, and allows for automatic transformation of JSON.
