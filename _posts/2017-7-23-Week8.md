Software Engineering with Downing was a whirlwind of an experience. If you've never done any web development before, this class will be difficult to say the least. This class will thrust you into using unknown technologies and will expect you to pull yourself up by your bootstraps and double down on learning many different things. The web projects aren't laid out in stone, and forces you to be creative in how you implement certain stages of the project. Be ready to welcome ambiguity.

The aforementioned paragraph is exactly why I loved this class. He lays out the minimum scaffolding in how he wants you to build the website by specifying some technologies to use, but you will be forced to learn many more when you dive head first into the murky swamp of web development. 

I knew absolutely zero web development technologies/languages before starting this class. By the end of this course, I can confidently say I've learned React, Javascript, Python, HTML, JSX, AWS, Apache, Flask, Webpack, Babel, React-Bootstrap, Flask-Restless, and probably 10 more miscellaneous, valuable technologies. How, you might ask, can you learn that much in a span of 8 weeks? The course is designed to dump you into the rapids, and you will either sink or swim, and when you're treading water, you'd be surprised at how quickly you're able to learn new things.

So, should you take this course? This course, above all, gave me direction. It exposed me to the war machine that is web development. I dipped my toes in the water and now I have an idea of where to go from here. I don't neccessarily want to go into web development, but the fundamentals that you pick up from this class will transcend into many other areas of software development. I can confidently say, yes, go get on the waitlist for this course. You won't regret it.
