**What did you do this past week?** This past week I worked on our Marveldb.net website and finished up the details of phase 2. Phase 2 entailed making our website dynamic, and including many instances of each of our data models. Phase 2 also required that we implement pagination, filtering, and sorting, which took the most time to implement. 
 
 **What's in your way?** I have been putting all of my time and effort into the website and have been neglecting the other aspects of the class, like the daily quizzes and test. The good thing is that the website functionality is looking pretty good. 

**What will you do next week?** Next week I'll be catching up on the other aspects of the class and working on phase 3 of our project which will be implementing search. We also will be covering relational algebra this week and how it pertains to database theory. Also, 4th of July is next week so I'll be visiting family, barbecuing, and having a few beers to blow off some steam after this intense phase of the project.

**What's my experience of the class?** To think that just a few weeks ago our group had absolutely no web development experience and that now we have built a fully functioning, dynamic website with pagination, filtering, and sorting is mind boggling. We have definitely put in many, many hours to make that happen but the amount of useful technologies we have learned because of this class is incredible.

**What is your pick-of-the-week?** Flask-Restless is an absolute must for phase 2 of this project. The Flask-Restless library has many built in functions that assist in server side pagination, filtering, and sorting. This alleviates a lot of the workload of trying to implement those phase 2 requirements for our website.
