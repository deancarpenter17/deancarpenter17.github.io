 **What did you do this past week?** This past week I started on the Collatz Conjecture project, and am about 95% done. All I have left is to do a couple more steps in the work flow and I can turn it in. It was a huge learning experience for me because of all the new technologies that were required for the project. 
 
 **What's in your way?** I need to become more familiar with the makefile and the Travis build configuration files.

**What will you do next week?** Next week we’ll be starting the group project, where we are tasked with building an IMDB-like website in a group. The groups for this project will be about five people, so it’ll be interesting working with a group of people to build this website and database from scratch.

**What's my experience of the class?** The class is extremely practical. Most CS classes I’ve taken have been very theoretical in nature, but this is heavily focused on actual technologies that are used in industry. The Travis continuous integration system is completely new to me, but it’s also my favorite technology that we use. It’s an incredibly useful tool to make sure that the new code you’re uploading isn’t failing old test cases. The best part of this is that it’s completely automated, so it saves you a ton of work.

**What is your pick-of-the-week?** If you work from the terminal quite often, consider using "tmux", which allows you to partition your terminal window. The lab computers come with this installed by default, so if you SSH into the lab computers quite a bit, it's as simple as typing tmux to enter the environment, then press CTRL-B, release, and then % to partition your screen vertically.
