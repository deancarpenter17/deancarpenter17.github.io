 **What's my experience of the class?** My first impression of professor Downing's Software Engineering course was excellent. He has a very unique teaching style that I've never seen before, but am very much a fan of. He randomly calls on students frequently in class and asks questions in a conversational manor about the topic he's teaching on. By doing this, it gives the class a much smaller, personal feel to it and commands your attention pretty effectively. Another aspect of his teaching style that I enjoy is his brevity in speaking. He explains the topics in an incredibly concise and practical way without sacrificing important details.
 
 **What did you do this past week?** This past week we went over the values of testing. Testing code allows you to make sure what you're about to write doesn't introduce unwanted bugs and operates the way you intended. Also, following the Agile model, if you write tests before you code anything you will have much more clarity about what your code is suppose to do. He explained the idea of continuous integration, which makes your life easier as a developer by running your previous tests anytime you commit to your code base. This _regression testing_ ensures that new features you introduce into your product doesn't break old test cases. We also had an introduction to Python, Docker, and the Collatz Conjecture.
 
 **What's in your way?** I'm unfamiliar with Python but have been studying up on it a bit this weekend. My first thoughts are that it's an absolute joy to code in. It seems to have an extremely simple methodology and it shows it some of the ways that it handles common expressions that are very verbose in languages like Java.

**What will you do next week?** Next week I'll be working on the assigned project for this course which is suppose to be related to the Collatz Conjecture.

**What is your pick-of-the-week?** I've recently started picking up a new language named Kotlin for use in Android development, and it's fantastic. Google recently announced at Google I/O that Kotlin is now an officially supported language for Android development. Kotlin greatly simplifies a lot of the code that you'd otherwise have to write in Java and allows features like lambda expressions that isn't available with the version of Java that is currently supported for Android development. Other nice features of this language include full interoperability with Java, default parameters, and null safety.
