**What did you do this past week?** This past week I worked on implementing search functionality into our website, marveldb.net. It was much easier than the previous phase of our website, but it certainly presented some challenges. We continued to flex the power of one of our libraries, Flask-Restless, which despite its name, allows us to build a RESTful API with all sorts of backend help with filtering, pagination, and search.
 
 **What's in your way?** I still need to focus more time and effort on studying up on the other details of the class, outside of the project. If other peoples grades are on the line for my performance, I tend to have tunnel vision in trying to make it the best that it can possibly be, even if that means putting off my own studying for quizzes/exams. 

**What will you do next week?** Next week I will be finalizing the last phase of our project, which will include cosmetic clean ups as well as preparing a presentation over our website. 

**What's my experience of the class?** The class has been incredibly helpful for me in understanding how software development works in the real world. We obviously can't cover everything in a 9 week course, but I now know the questions that I need to ask and the areas to research to prepare for a software development job. I also know that I would prefer to never work with Javascript again.

**What is your pick-of-the-week?** I discovered a python library while browsing the trending repos on Github named Magic Wormhole. Magic Wormhole allows you to send files to another person from the command line incredibly easy and securely, without messing with USB drives, attaching files to emails, or any other incredibly unsecure way. Magic Wormhole is available to install on the command line through Pip, and once installed you simply type: 'wormhole send yourfile.txt'. This will produce a secret message that you then give to the other person, who then types: 'wormhole receive', it will then prompt you for the secret code. When entered correctly, you instantly receive the files in your directory and the wormhole closes. That simple.
