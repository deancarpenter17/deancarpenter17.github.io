  My first impression of professor Downing's Software Engineering course was excellent. He has a very unique teaching style that I've never seen before, but am very much a fan of. He calls on students very frequently in class and asks questions about the particular topic he's teaching on. By doing this, it gives the class a much smaller, personal feel to it and commands your attention pretty effectively. Another aspect of his teaching style that I'm a fan of is his brevity in speaking. He explains the topics in an incredibly concise and practical way without giving up important details.
