  My first impression of professor Downing's Software Engineering course was excellent. He has a very unique teaching style that I've never seen before, but am very much a fan of. He calls on students very frequently in class and asks questions about the topic he's teaching on. By doing this, it gives the class a much smaller, personal feel to it and commands your attention pretty effectively. Another aspect of his teaching style that I enjoy is his brevity in speaking. He explains the topics in an incredibly concise and practical way without sacrificing important details.
  
  **What did you do this past week?** This past week we went over the values of testing. Testing code allows you to make sure what you're about to write doesn't introduce unwanted bugs and operates the way you intended. Also, following the Agile model, if you write tests before you code anything you will have much more clarity about what your code is suppose to do. He explained the idea of continuous integration, which makes your life easier as a developer by running your previous tests anytime you commit to your code base. This _regression testing_ ensures that new features you introduce into your product doesn't break old test cases.
